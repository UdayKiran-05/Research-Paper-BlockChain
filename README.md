Blockchain Technology-A new Era for Secure and Transparent Voting


ABSTRACT 
Blockchain technology offers a revolutionary approach to secure and transparent voting systems, addressing long-standing challenges such as fraud, voter manipulation, and lack of trust in traditional voting mechanisms. This paper explores the potential of blockchain to provide a decentralized, tamper-resistant, and verifiable voting platform, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness in electoral processes. By leveraging the immutable nature of blockchain, the proposed system enables secure storage of votes, protection against unauthorized access, and real-time tracking without compromising voter anonymity. Key technical aspects such as smart contracts, consensus mechanisms, and cryptographic techniques are discussed as integral components of the systemâ€™s design. The paper also presents potential applications of blockchain voting in both governmental elections and private sector decision-making processes. Additionally, it highlights the challenges, such as scalability and regulatory concerns, that must be overcome for widespread adoption. The findings suggest that blockchain-based voting could lead to increased voter confidence and engagement, marking a new era in election integrity.
